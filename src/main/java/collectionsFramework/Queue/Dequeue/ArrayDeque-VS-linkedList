-------ArrayDeque--------:

-This class implements the Deque and the Queue interface.
-Unlike Queue, we can add or remove elements from both sides.
-Null elements are not allowed in the ArrayDeque
-ArrayDeque is not thread safe, in the absence of external synchronization.
-ArrayDeque is faster than LinkedList and Stack
-It uses an array to store its elements, and its size changes dynamically as elements are added or removed.

-------LinkedList---------:
-LinkedList supports null elements, whereas ArrayDeque doesn't.
-Each node in a linked list includes links to other nodes. That's why LinkedList requires more storage than ArrayDeque.
-On the other hand, LinkedList is a better choice if you need fast add and remove operations in the middle of the Deque.


-So, if you need a Deque that mainly performs add and remove operations at both ends, ArrayDeque is a better choice.
-If you need a Deque that mainly performs add and remove operations in the middle, LinkedList is a better choice.
