-A map contains values on the basis of key, i.e. key and value pair. Each key and value pair is known as an entry.
-A Map contains unique keys.
-A Map doesn't allow duplicate keys, but you can have duplicate values. HashMap and LinkedHashMap allow null keys and values, but TreeMap doesn't allow any null key or value.
-A Map is useful if you have to search, update or delete elements on the basis of a key.
-There are two interfaces for implementing Map in java: Map and SortedMap, and three classes: HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap.
-A Map can't be traversed, so you need to convert it into Set using keySet() or entrySet() method.
-Order of keys is not preserved
